### A LaTeX template for CIHR grant applications

[LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org//) is a powerful open-source markup language for typesetting documents.  It generates beautiful PDFs and is an ideal framework for detailed version control of your writing projects.  

I've been tremendously fortunate to have grants funded by the [Canadian Institutes of Health Research](http://www.cihr-irsc.gc.ca/) and have authored those research proposals in LaTeX.  To help promote (in a very small way) the uptake of LaTeX in my scientific community, I've uploaded these template files that should be straight-forward to populate with any research proposal.  

### Disclaimer
These are pretty simple files that are only meant to provide a convenient resource for scientific colleagues who are new to LaTeX.  Users are responsible for ensuring that the resulting documents fulfill agency requirements -- of course I can't provide any guarantee.  Good luck!
