### A LaTeX template for CIHR grant applications

[LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org//) is a powerful open-source markup language for typesetting documents.  It generates beautiful PDFs and is an ideal framework for detailed version control of your writing projects.  

I've been tremendously fortunate to have grants funded by the [Canadian Institutes of Health Research](http://www.cihr-irsc.gc.ca/) and have authored those research proposals in LaTeX.  To help promote the uptake of LaTeX in my scientific community, I've uploaded these template files that should be straight-forward to populate with any research proposal.
